### 1. **16-Qubit Random Number Generator**

A quantum random number generator (QRNG) uses the inherent randomness of quantum states to produce unpredictable sequences. With 16 qubits, this QRNG would use quantum superposition and measurement principles to ensure randomness.

**Concepts Needed:**
   - **Qubits**: The basic unit of quantum information. A qubit can exist in a superposition of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`.
   - **Superposition**: Allows qubits to hold both `0` and `1` states simultaneously, generating a fundamentally unpredictable result when measured.
   - **Measurement**: Collapses the superposition, resulting in either `0` or `1`. In QRNG, measuring superpositions generates random outcomes.
   - **Entanglement (optional)**: Can be used to increase the complexity and unpredictability of outcomes when generating random numbers.

### 2. **Tackling Noise with Error Correction**

Quantum error correction (QEC) is crucial in handling noise that affects qubits. Qubits are highly susceptible to decoherence and noise due to environmental factors, and QEC helps to stabilize them.

**Concepts Needed:**
